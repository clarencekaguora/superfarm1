1. Measure and Map Your Garden
Take advantage of Google for this task. Find a satellite image of your property on Google Maps, then print it and draw your garden on the printed page.

2. Divide Your Garden Into Plots
Parson's 2-acre farm is divided into 13 separate plots, but your farm might only have four to eight, depending on its size. 

3. You can draw your plots in any shape you want, but Parson points out that longer, rectangular blocks are easier to work using a tractor than shorter, square blocks. 

Number each plot so you can refer to it easily.

3. Group Crops
Now comes the tricky part: deciding what you want to plant this year. Group those crops by family and season of planting and harvest. 


4. For successful succession cropping, you need serious planning. You can be really fancy and put together a whole spreadsheet of your crop, variety, planting date and days to harvest like Parson does or figure out a record-keeping system of your own. 

5. Outline Your Plan
Make a chart of each plot number and each season, like the example in step 3. Next to each season, fill in what you'll plant there. Some crops will be in the field for more than one season. 

6. Likewise, you can intercrop, planting more than one crop in that plot per season, such as both broccoli and cabbage in plot 1 in the fall. Just be sure to stick to plants of the same family.
